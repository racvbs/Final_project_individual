# We did it! I did it!

I was part of a beautiful project with a great team of people.

The strengths of the team were various and wonderful! Enrico has vision to challenge us to make business decisions in the analysis, Luis has to much experience of programming to analyse data and his ideas were great to put in order our project, Cielo is very organize, detail and clean programmer, so, I was very happy to work with them.

I hope my statistical skills would helped to be part of this great project.

I was in charge of think the database in the first steps, based on Endeavor's investigations, I also define the variables in each step of the process while the rest of the team contributes in cleaning and program the dataframe.

I also were part of modeling, I've made logistic regression (something that I love to do!).
The powerful of google colab in payton, pandas made things very easy to do, and that help the team focus in analysis and not in tools because Paython and R are the best tools.

The models were very beatiful, this is the content table of my code for logistic regression:

We hope, as a team, go to the Demo Day and I really want to continue to work in this project with my team.

# Database

Entrepreneurship is very important concept nowadays, all the data was awesome and the strategy was make some calculations in order to have the best "goodlooking" variables to fit our models.

# Analysis

Important fact: there were 3 'y' and we did Neural Network, Logistic Regression and Random Forest w/unbalanced, balanced, over sampling, under sampling and smote. So, there a lot of models, points of view and learning during this process of decision.

# Conclusion

The more money they collect during the first stages, the more likely they are going to be successful

We want to know more!
